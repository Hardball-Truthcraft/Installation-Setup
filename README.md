HIS Tool Suite — AI Truth Engine

Version: Updated with enhanced GPT logic

Purpose:
HIS Tool Suite is Hardball Intelligence Systems’ AI Truth Engine — a no-frills, fortress-grade platform for cutting through narrative crap, exposing contradictions, and anchoring discourse in logic, history, and outcomes.

1. Overview

Truth is not a feature; it's a weapon. HIS Tool Suite uses improved GPT modules to:

Detect cognitive and logical inconsistencies.

Evaluate real‑world effectiveness via the Destruction vs. Flourishing (DvF) Scale.

Flag ideological word salad with the Bullshit Flag–powered logic engine.

Support intelligible, evidence-based truth deployment in public discourse, analysis, and policy.

2. What’s New in This Version

Upgraded GPT Logic Core: Sharper inference, faster contradiction detection, better historical precedent synthesis.

Enhanced DvF Scoring Integration: Now draws from a broader evidence base (case studies, datasets, empirical outcomes).

Bullshit Flag 2.0: Reduced false positives, more granular thresholds, and smarter context awareness.

Reputation Modeling (Beta): Preliminary module tracking ideological consistency across sources.

Expanded Prompt Library: Updated with domain-specific templates for media analysis, policy evaluation, academic claims, and more.

3. Features

Truth Scan: Input statements or arguments; returns logical coherence, historical comparisons, DvF score, and Bullshit Flag verdict.

Policy Forecaster: Predicts societal impact of policy ideas using DvF scoring—think of it like a logical ordnance calculator.

Debate Heatmap: Highlights weak claims, logical fallacies, and unsupported claims in debate transcripts.

Reputation Tracker (Beta): Assesses consistency of public claims over time; triangulates against factual records.
